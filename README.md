This is a cross-platform joystick-driven music-tracker.

It uses [CLAP](https://github.com/free-audio/clap) for sound-generation and effects, which you can sequence. This allows a wide variety of instrument-types, from the same interface.

## usage

You should be able to track quickly with a joystick, or keys:

It may seem a bit inscrutable at first, but input is meant to be consistent and fast with a joystick, so once you get the hang of it, it should work well. A is "edit/change value", B is "delete/reset/cancel", X is "fill column", Y is "clear column", SELECT + arrow is "change screen", and START is "play song/pattern".

### plugins

There are some built-in units (effects/sound-generators) but you can also use CLAP plugins.

**Instruments**
- [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/) — subtractive/wavetable synth; good first test
- [Vital](https://vital.audio/) — wavetable synth, free tier
- [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/) — DX7 FM emulation
- [OB-Xd](https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/) — Oberheim-style analog

**Effects**
- [Airwindows](https://www.airwindows.com/) — large collection of free DSP effects
